twolayer_separate.py is the latest file for two-layer preferential attachment simulation. It shows 
user-server graph and server-clique graph separately. server_clique_twolayer.py intends to show both
layers on the same graph but it is not working yet.

pref_attach_clusters.py is the latest file for preferential attachment simulation with clusters. Command
line arguments for hyperparameters are waiting for implementation.

pref_attach_directional.py is the latest file for preferential attachment simulation with directed edges. 
It can choose the number of edges to add with a new node by a constant, a random number in a range, or a 
random number in a range of power-law distribution. See help for more info or check args in the py file.
