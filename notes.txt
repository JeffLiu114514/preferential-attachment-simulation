Questions:
1. Do we mean cliques by no relays connect any server in one clique to another?
2. Does power-law works for cliques? Is there a process like a user choosing people to follow? If not,
how is there a preferential attachment on server-clique layer?
3. Do we want users to have PA globally, inside their own server, or inside the clique their server is in?(currently inside server)

Details for future implementation:
linear/non-linear preferential attachment
