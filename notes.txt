TODO:
two-layer + clustering

Questions:
linear/non-linear preferential attachment? use super-linear or sub-linear?
if new nodes tend to connect to existing ones with linear probability in the degree of the existing nodes 
then preferential attachment leads to a scale-free network (simple simulation)
